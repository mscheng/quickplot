quickplot is a general set of functions for generating bitmaps and plotting them in jpg, tiff, png, hdf5, and pdb formats. The main advantages of using quickplot over other plotting packages are:

- The ability to manually modify bitmaps
- Very fast line drawing (~ 200,000 lines/minute)
- Can output in simple plot formats (jpg, tiff, png) and structured scientific plot formast (hdf5 and pdb) allowing users to view their images in the VisIt visualization program.
